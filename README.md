# Song Popularity Prediction

AI is being used a lot in music these days, like in making music or creating new versions of existing songs. These AI-created songs are getting just as popular as regular ones. Because of this, we got curious about what things make a song popular.

This curiosity led us to a basic question: Can we figure out if a song is popular just by looking at its musical parts? To find out, we made a machine learning model that can tell if a song is likely to be popular or not.

We think this program can be really useful for the music industry. It can help them decide if an album will be a big hit or not before they release it. This means they can save time and money and work more efficiently.
